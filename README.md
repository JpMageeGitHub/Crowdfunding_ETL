## About
This project was to practice our skills building databases and schemas using raw data for a crowdfunding project. We extracted data from a json file, transformed it into csv files using pandas, python, regex, etc.,  and loaded it into a created database for analysis.



## Contributing
W3schools --> data types for table creations in the schema
Classwork --> helped with syntax for each step
postgres documentation --> guided predefined functions
regex documentation --> character manipulation
StackOverflow --> used similar example for creating category and subcategory columns
